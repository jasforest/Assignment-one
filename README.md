Reading data file:
  The algorithm that transfers all the data from tag.csv to arraylist is linear search        
  Running time: O(n)
  

Sorting arraylist in alphabetical order:
  The algorithm used in mergesort which has the time complexity of O(nLog(n)). It's faster than my original run time- O(n^2). I chose this algorithm because we aren't able to use collections function and also we learned this algorithm in class too. 
  

Adding elements into unique array/Counting frequency of word:
  this algorithm has the time complexity of O(n) since we have to loop through each word to find any matches and increment the count at the same time.
